Missing features/refactoring:
Check for valid tiles in tileStrategy
Make ThetaTileStrategy
    Where desert is a valid tile. Currently desert is added to game constants and is valid in all variants..
Make UnitStrategy as interface and refactor for all variants
    Refactor for AlphaUnitStrategy
    Make ThetaUnitStrategy
        Where sandworm is a valid unit. Currently sandworm is added to game constants and is valid in all variants..
    The layout generator in GameImpl should use TileStrategy to check for valid tile types
Sandworm devour action
